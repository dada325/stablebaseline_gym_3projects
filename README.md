# stablebaseline_gym_3projects
This is a test Project for using stable baseline framwork testing with gymnasium env. 



## Basic Env and Testing with PPO Algorithm 

The file [baseline](baseline.ipynb) is a tesing for using the framework stable baseline and Pytorch in the environment of Gymnasium.
In the test of playing the classic control,cartpole, the PPO algorithm achive a avg reward of 500. 

## Project 1 Breakout

File [Project of Break Out](Project_Break_out.ipynb) for the A2C algorithm using framework of stable baseline, using CnnPolicy for the network arch, 

## Project 2 Self-driving

File [Self driving for racing car](Self_driving) is a testing of the algorithm of PPO in the stable baseline, CNN Policy for the network, 

## Project 3 Custom-Env

File [Custom your own Environment](Custon_Env.ipynb) show you how you can create your own game environment, to create the action space, observation space, reward, state transition and so on in the 
Gymnasium environment.
